# Athena System Architecture

## Overview
Athena is a comprehensive misinformation detection and analysis platform that combines machine learning models with knowledge graphs and verification systems to identify and combat misinformation.

## System Components

### 1. Frontend (React Native)
- **Screens**: User interfaces for content submission, analysis, and education
- **Components**: Reusable UI elements
- **Services**: API clients for backend communication
- **State Management**: Context API or Redux for state management

### 2. Backend (FastAPI)
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for client communication
- **Models**: ML/DL models for misinformation detection
- **Services**: Business logic and integration points
- **Database**: Firestore for structured data storage
- **Cache**: Redis for performance optimization

### 3. Machine Learning Pipeline
- **Data Preprocessing**: Text cleaning and feature extraction
- **Model Training**: Training and fine-tuning of detection models
- **Inference**: Real-time prediction of misinformation
- **Evaluation**: Performance monitoring and model validation

### 4. Knowledge Graph
- **Entity Extraction**: Identifying entities in text
- **Relationship Mapping**: Establishing connections between entities
- **Verification**: Cross-referencing with trusted sources

### 5. GCP Integration
- **Firestore**: Document database for structured data
- **Pub/Sub**: Asynchronous message queue
- **Cloud Storage**: For media and model storage
- **Vertex AI**: Model hosting and deployment

## Data Flow

1. **Content Submission**
   - User submits content through the frontend
   - Content is sent to the backend API
   - System logs the submission and assigns a tracking ID

2. **Content Analysis**
   - Text is preprocessed and features are extracted
   - ML models analyze the content for misinformation signals
   - Knowledge graph is queried for context and verification

3. **Result Generation**
   - Analysis results are compiled
   - Confidence scores and explanations are generated
   - Response is sent back to the frontend

4. **Feedback Loop**
   - User feedback is collected
   - Models are retrained with new data
   - System performance is continuously monitored

## Security Considerations

- **Data Privacy**: All user data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for API access
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DDoS attacks
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all system activities

## Scalability

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless services can be scaled independently
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across multiple instances
- **Caching**: Reduces database load for frequently accessed data
- **Async Processing**: Long-running tasks are handled asynchronously

It is estimated that we’ve already removed about [30%](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2022/04/forests-ice-age/) of the world's forests since the last ice age.\n\nIt is estimated that we have already lost about 30% of the world's forests.\n\n## Why is it important to understand the effects of deforestation?\n\nUnderstanding deforestation effects is important because forests play a vital role to the health of ecosystems and human life. Forests help regulate the climate by absorbing carbon dioxide. They also provide oxygen and support countless species of plants and animals.\n\nWhen forests are cleared, it leads to more carbon in the atmosphere, which contributes to global warming. It also harms wildlife, disrupts water cycles, and affects people who rely on forests for food, clean water, and shelter.

Youâ€™re talking to someone who says that fossil fuels arenâ€™t causing climate change. Or that climate change is happening naturally, and not because of anything that humans do.\n\nMaybe you know these things arenâ€™t right, but you donâ€™t speak up. Youâ€™re worried that you donâ€™t know enough.\n\nIf youâ€™d like to have more confident conversations about how fossil fuels drive climate change, read on! Talking about climate change with the facts helps correct the false information thatâ€™s out there. It can also inspire action in the people around you and build a movement for a greener future.\n\n## **What are fossil fuels?**\n\nFossil fuels come from the remains of plants, animals, and plankton that died millions of years ago. As they decayed, they created carbon-rich deposits called **fossil fuels**.\n\nFossil fuels include coal, natural gas, and oil. They supply around [80%](https://www.energyinst.org/statistical-review) of the worldâ€™s energy. We burn them to generate heat and electricity and power cars, trains, ships, and planes. We also use them to make plastic and many other products.\n\nThe Jackpine mine tailings pond, part of Albertaâ€™s tar sands, northeast of Fort McKay. Â© Greenpeace\n\nWhen fossil fuels are burned, they release large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the air. Carbon dioxide is one of the main **greenhouse gases**. These gases in our atmosphere act like the walls of a greenhouse, trapping heat from the sun inside of them.\n\nHuman activities have added more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution, which lasted from around 1760 to 1890. This was a time when many countries around the world shifted from farming to machine manufacturing. Today, the atmosphere has [50%](https://www.climate.gov/media/14596) more carbon dioxide than it did in 1750.\n\nAll this extra greenhouse gas is heating up our atmosphere, leading to long-term changes in temperature and weather patterns called **climate change**.

NMSEA works to educate the public about the benefits of solar energy, encourage the adoption of renewable energy technologies, and promote policies that support renewable energy development in New Mexico.\n\nNMSEA offers a variety of resources, including workshops, training events, and advocacy, to help individuals and businesses in New Mexico embrace solar power and other renewable energy sources. The organization also hosts events and conferences to bring together experts, industry leaders, and community members to share knowledge and ideas about renewable energy.\n\n## The SunChaser program\n\nNMSEA\'s nationally recognized SunChaser Education Program is one of our organization\'s principal outreach programs. Our instructors visit schools and special events to present programs to promote energy awareness and alternative energy solutions in a format that is aligned with state education requirements and standards.

A lot of students and schoolers write their dissertations, research papers, and essays about Solar energy, and we trust that we influenced their choice of an essay topic.

It can also inspire action in the people around you and build a movement for a greener future.\n\n## **What are fossil fuels?**\n\nFossil fuels come from the remains of plants, animals, and plankton that died millions of years ago. As they decayed, they created carbon-rich deposits called **fossil fuels**.\n\nFossil fuels include coal, natural gas, and oil. They supply around [80%](https://www.energyinst.org/statistical-review) of the worldâ€™s energy. We burn them to generate heat and electricity and power cars, trains, ships, and planes. We also use them to make plastic and many other products.\n\nThe Jackpine mine tailings pond, part of Albertaâ€™s tar sands, northeast of Fort McKay. Â© Greenpeace\n\nWhen fossil fuels are burned, they release large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the air. Carbon dioxide is one of the main **greenhouse gases**. These gases in our atmosphere act like the walls of a greenhouse, trapping heat from the sun inside of them.\n\nHuman activities have added more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution, which lasted from around 1760 to 1890. This was a time when many countries around the world shifted from farming to machine manufacturing. Today, the atmosphere has [50%](https://www.climate.gov/media/14596) more carbon dioxide than it did in 1750.\n\nAll this extra greenhouse gas is heating up our atmosphere, leading to long-term changes in temperature and weather patterns called **climate change**.

It is estimated that weâ€™ve already removed about [30%](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2022/04/forests-ice-age/) of the world's forests since the last ice age.\n\nIt is estimated that we have already lost about 30% of the world's forests.\n\n## Why is it important to understand the effects of deforestation?\n\nUnderstanding deforestation effects is important because forests play a vital role to the health of ecosystems and human life. Forests help regulate the climate by absorbing carbon dioxide. They also provide oxygen and support countless species of plants and animals.\n\nWhen forests are cleared, it leads to more carbon in the atmosphere, which contributes to global warming. It also harms wildlife, disrupts water cycles, and affects people who rely on forests for food, clean water, and shelter. Understanding these effects helps us make better choices to protect forests and ensure a healthier planet for future generations.\n\nDeforestation as a result of gold mining in Peru\n\n## Is deforestation illegal?\n\nDeforestation can be illegal, but it depends on the country, the method used, and whether proper laws are followed. In many places, there are laws that protect forests from being cut down without permission.\n\nFor example, cutting down trees in protected areas like national parks is usually illegal.

Previous modelling studies show that the global surface air temperature (SAT) response to deforestation depends on latitude, with most simulations showing that high latitude deforestation results in cooling, low latitude deforestation causes warming and that the mid latitude response is mixed. These earlier conclusions are based on simulated large scal land cover change, with complete removal of trees from whole latitude bands. Using a global climate model we examine the effects of removing fractions of 5% to 100% of forested areas in the high, mid and low latitudes. All high latitude deforestation scenarios reduce mean global SAT, the opposite occurring for low latitude deforestation, although a decrease in SAT is simulated over low latitude deforested areas. Mid latitude SAT response is mixed. In all simulations deforested areas tend to become drier and have lower SAT, although soil temperatures increase over deforested mid and low latitude grid cells.

2025-08-25 09:24:25,885 - __main__ - INFO -   Claim: Archaeologists in Turkey recently uncovered evidence suggesting that the ancient Hittites bred giant bees the size of crows
2025-08-25 09:24:25,886 - __main__ - INFO -     Verdict: Refuted
2025-08-25 09:24:25,887 - __main__ - INFO -     Reasoning: Failed to evaluate the evidence due to technical issues.

2025-08-25 09:24:25,888 - __main__ - INFO -   Claim: Archaeologists in Turkey recently uncovered evidence suggesting that the ancient Hittites bred giant bees to transport honey across long distances
2025-08-25 09:24:25,888 - __main__ - INFO -     Verdict: Refuted
2025-08-25 09:24:25,889 - __main__ - INFO -     Reasoning: None of the provided sources mention that the Hittites bred giant bees to transport honey across long distances. The sources discuss apiculture in the ancient Near East, including the Hittites, but focus on honey production, trade, and the role of bees in culture and religion. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.
